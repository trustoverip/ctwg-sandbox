The purpose of such <a href="/ctwg-sandbox/docs/terms/governance"><span style="font-weight:bold">governance</span></a> is to support organizations as they transform their IT, their business-process artifacts, such as forms, and their policies to reap the benefits of SSI. This paper introduces <a href="/ctwg-sandbox/docs/terms/ssi-ac"><span style="font-weight:bold">SSI Assurance Communities</span></a> (<a href="/ctwg-sandbox/docs/terms/ssi-ac"><span style="font-weight:bold">SSI-ACs</span></a>) and identifies three specific governance topics: credential-types, accreditation and decision tree support. Tools and services are suggested that help with these topics. Furthermore, a distinction is made between what the business primarily cares about (business and business applications), and the technology and other things that are just expected to work (which we call &quot;<a href="/ctwg-sandbox/docs/terms/ssi-infrastructure"><span style="font-weight:bold">SSI-infrastructure</span></a>&quot;).</p><p>Here are the main takeaways:</p><ul><li>Self-sovereign identity could save time and money on bureaucratic processes (form filling and validation) by automating business decisions.</li><li>Business decisions require <a href="/ctwg-sandbox/docs/terms/governance"><span style="font-weight:bold">governance</span></a> to ensure the data used for making them qualifies (is valid) for that purpose, and continuously remains compliant with laws, regulations, and company policies (which regularly change).</li><li>Companies could share this governance burden by supporting communities that support the provisioning of SSI-related assurances for their specific purposes.</li><li>Such (focused) <a href="/ctwg-sandbox/docs/terms/ssi-ac"><span style="font-weight:bold">assurance communities</span></a> could be supported by tools like <a href="/ctwg-sandbox/docs/terms/credential-catalogue"><span style="font-weight:bold">credential catalogues</span></a> and accreditation credentials.</li></ul><p>We hope this paper inspires SSI proponents to develop not only real <a href="/ctwg-sandbox/docs/terms/ssi-infrastructure"><span style="font-weight:bold">SSI infrastructure</span></a>, but also assurance mechanisms for exchanging %qualified data.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="why-ssi---saving-time-and-money-on-bureaucracy"></a>Why SSI - Saving time and money on bureaucracy<a class="hash-link" href="#why-ssi---saving-time-and-money-on-bureaucracy" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>SSI promises big benefits: better data quality, faster and cheaper data validation and decision-making, higher conversion rates and customer satisfaction, less churn, fewer IT-links<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>, and operational costs, et cetera.</p><p>We estimate that in the Netherlands alone, monetary benefits are over 1Bn euro<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup>, waiting time for information can be reduced from hours (days, weeks) to seconds (minutes), and many IT-links can be dismantled.</p><p>SSI allows individuals to store and exchange qualified data when they want to, making it easier to fill in (digital) forms. This improves the individual‚Äôs interaction experience with the system. Currently, there are many problems that an individual can experience. Examples are not understanding what is being asked for, where to get the data or documents, and challenges and/or errors when entering data into the form. Moreover, sometimes you need to physically go somewhere to get a (signed) document, or scanning documents and uploading PDFs. The <a href="https://www.nationaleombudsman.nl/system/files/onderzoek/Rapport%202019046%20Houd%20het%20simpel.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dutch National Ombudsman</a> has shown that everyone - including people with academic degrees, or lots of IT experience - faces these challenges.</p><p>On the other side, organizations can also benefit from the use of SSI. At this moment, organizations need to deal with unqualified data (e.g. typed or uploaded, without any assurances about anything), errors and unsatisfied customers. SSI can provide them with assurances (e.g. regarding the provenance and integrity of such data, required accreditations of the data source, etc.) they need to qualify the data for the purposes they intend to use it.</p><p>Indirectly, yet nonetheless important for (some?) governments, is that SSI may help to reduce the ‚Äòdigital divide‚Äô,<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3" class="footnote-ref">3</a></sup> People in lower socio-economic classes tend to find filling in forms more difficult, yet have to fill out most of the forms as they apply for social benefits and support. Typically, these forms are not the easiest to understand. As a result, these people give up, often for very good reasons, and therefore do not get benefits they are entitled to. Moreover, they do not file complaints if things go wrong. With SSI technology as their companion, all this can change.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-challenge-automating-business-decisions-based-on-qualified-data"></a>The challenge: automating business decisions based on qualified data<a class="hash-link" href="#the-challenge-automating-business-decisions-based-on-qualified-data" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>While most business decision makers can see the benefits and even want to reap them, acceptance is still an issue. Since SSI is still in its infancy, we would only expect ‚Äòinnovators‚Äô and ‚Äòearly adopters‚Äô to be interested.<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4" class="footnote-ref">4</a></sup> So what issues are being raised for (currently) not engaging?</p><p>First, the technology still is not sufficiently mature. While many vendors are already developing SSI components and/or solutions, they do not yet (easily) interoperate with business applications or SSI components of other developers. Standardized specifications for APIs, credential exchange protocols, and other fundamental processes are still lacking.</p><p>Fortunately, these technical issues are being addressed and we expect to see them being resolved over the coming years. As a result, we foresee a generic SSI-infrastructure that is accessible for all (SSI-enabled) business applications, equally pervasive as the Internet IP-infrastructure. The main difference from a business point of view between the two is that the IP-infrastructure can be used to exchange <em>any</em> data, while the SSI-infrastructure will specifically be used for providing, requesting and obtaining <em>qualified</em> data. This is data that comes with assurances regarding its provenance and integrity, and that can be combined electronically in semantically valid ways.</p><div class="admonition admonition-info alert alert--info"><div class="admonition-heading"><h5><span class="admonition-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="14" height="16" viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>Qualified Data</h5></div><div class="admonition-content"><p><em>Qualified data</em>: data that comes with assurances, at least regarding its provenance and integrity, and that can be combined electronically in semantically valid ways.</p></div></div><p>Second, business managers need to create and maintain the (machine readable) policies for the SSI infrastructure to provide such services. For verifiers, these policies can specify the kind of credentials that are needed for the different business transactions, and the issuers that can be trusted to give certain statements. For issuers, the policies can specify to whom, and under which conditions the party will issue credentials, together with the kind of assurance it is willing to offer to whom. Also, policies could give requirements to holders, on how to use specific credentials, etc. These policies can be hierarchical. For example, small policies of small business need to fit into the bigger policies of the country the business is in.</p><p>This puts a burden on business governance processes: creating and maintaining the (machine readable) policies for the issuance, storing, verification and validation of credentials wasn‚Äôt required before. Reliable processes are required to develop and maintain machine readable policies that are clear, unambiguous, complete, consistent, coherent and precise, as machines cannot deal with incompleteness, inconsistencies, incoherence, impreciseness or ambiguities the way humans (often) can.</p><p>Finally, many managers do not want to take the risk of being or becoming non-compliant. This means that the new SSI IT, the processes that use them and all related (digital) policies have to be made explainable to third parties such as auditors (who are expected to have sufficient prerequisite knowledge) and judges (who generally do not).</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="towards-ssi-adoption-and-transformation"></a>Towards SSI Adoption And Transformation<a class="hash-link" href="#towards-ssi-adoption-and-transformation" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>We expect that more organizations will adopt SSI and transform their business processes and IT systems when it becomes easier for them to do so.</p><p>For now, let‚Äôs assume that the technology issues of interoperability, scalability etc. have been addressed, and that SSI infrastructure technology is a commodity, in the same way as the Internet IPv4/IPv6 infrastructure currently is. This would mean a set of standardized protocols exist (analogous to HTTP and FTP) for issuing credentials and obtaining them, for combining credentials from different issuers into a new credential and present that to others, and for requesting such ‚Äòpresentations‚Äô because you need the data.<sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5" class="footnote-ref">5</a></sup> Also, we would see applications from various vendors (analogous to web clients/browsers and servers) that use these protocols in pretty much the same way, but for different purposes. For example, a ‚Äòuser wallet‚Äô would focus on obtaining credentials and constructing presentations upon request. Vendors compete on UX, security, features, etc., but the basic functionality is the same. In a similar fashion, we expect to see components that serve a party‚Äôs needs for issuing credentials (the ‚Äòissuer component‚Äô), and components that serve to collect data from different issuers, usually for the purpose of making a decision of some kind (the ‚Äòvalidator<sup id="fnref-6"><a href="#fn-6" class="footnote-ref">6</a></sup> component‚Äô).</p><p>Once SSI is a (commodity) infrastructure as described above, organizations will expect it to properly function on a 24/7 basis, just like any other infrastructure (e.g. for energy, transportation, the Internet etc.). They expect to be able to buy devices, appliances etc. that properly work with such infrastructures, and they do not want to be required to know all technical details.</p><p>The crucial component that organizations (as well as individuals) will need is what we will call the ‚ÄòSSI-gateway‚Äô (which is a currently non-existent component<sup id="fnref-7"><a href="#fn-7" class="footnote-ref">7</a></sup>). Its function is to ensure that data being exchanged is qualified, i.e. the data is valid to be used as business information for the intended purposes. Specifically, it allows businesses to</p><ul><li>provide arbitrary data-sets to others that request them, adding proofs of provenance and integrity in a way that the requesting party can process, thereby making and issuing ‚Äòqualified data‚Äô. Such qualified data may come in different forms, e.g. as Verifiable Credentials (VC), X.509 attribute certificates, SAML tokens, Attribute-Based Credentials (ABC), OpenID Connect scopes, etc.</li><li>request a data-set, the contents of which is constructed in a semantically valid way from a number of credentials, each of which is provably issued by a party that the business trusts in that, and hasn‚Äôt been changed in transit. The response to such a request can be used to automatically fill in forms with qualified data that needs no further validation activities.</li></ul><p>It helps organizations to reduce the time and effort spent on validating information to the bare minimum. It allows them to focus on the contents (payloads) of credentials, the ‚Äòqualified data‚Äô, rather than the ‚Äòenvelopes‚Äô that the various kinds of credentials specify. This is similar to TCP/IP, the main interest of which is sending and receiving (unqualified) data, without being bothered by the ‚Äòenvelope‚Äô (the IP-header).<sup id="fnref-8"><a href="#fn-8" class="footnote-ref">8</a></sup></p><p>However, organizations <em>do</em> take an interest in, and pay attention to</p><ul><li>the actual (kinds of) qualified data (credential payloads), insofar they may serve purposes of an organization‚Äôs business or its information processes;</li><li>the kinds of qualified data that the organization itself might create and issue credentials with, insofar that fits with its business strategy/purposes;</li><li>assurances that it needs to designate data as being qualified, i.e. assurances that help mitigate any (unacceptable) risk that the organization perceives to run as a result of using such data in its information processes;</li><li>how to construct arguments using this qualified data, insofar such arguments lead to qualified decisions (i.e. decisions that are based on qualified data) that are relevant to the organization - irrespective of such decisions are to be made by the organization itself or some other party.</li></ul><p>Let‚Äôs look at each of these more closely.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="three-perspectives-on-qualified-data-issuer-validator-and-holder"></a>Three perspectives on qualified data: issuer, validator, and holder<a class="hash-link" href="#three-perspectives-on-qualified-data-issuer-validator-and-holder" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>As with credentials, qualified data can be looked at from different perspectives: the ‚Äòissuer perspective‚Äô, the ‚Äòvalidator perspective‚Äô<sup id="fnref-9"><a href="#fn-9" class="footnote-ref">9</a></sup> and the ‚Äòholder perspective‚Äô. In the following sections, an explanation is given what these perspectives are and how the different roles can act in a decentralized governance.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-issuer-perspective"></a>The Issuer Perspective<a class="hash-link" href="#the-issuer-perspective" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>In its issuer role, a party is interested in creating value from sharing the knowledge it has about (other) entities (people, organizations, or things). Various business models exist for different organizations. For example, a government may decide to create credentials with citizen data (not just name and address, but also marital status and children, data concerning taxes, various permits, ownerships, guardianships, mandates, etc.). This may result in savings on bureaucracy that outweigh the costs of implementing credential issuing.</p><p>In order to reap the benefits expected by the business model, issuers should provide data that others will actually use, and do so with proofs of provenance, integrity and perhaps other assurances. This means that the issuer must communicate (advertise) the existence of such data in such a way that others can not only find it, but also decide whether or not that data is beneficial (for <em>them</em>) to use. An ‚Äòadvertisement‚Äô not only needs to say ‚Äòwhat‚Äô the data is about, but also what its characteristics are (e.g. that this issued data is guaranteed to be 1-1 equal to the registrations of the issuer, unless the credential in which it is contained has expired or has been revoked), the liability (if any) that the issuer is prepared to take, conditions of use, etc.</p><p>From the issuer perspective, it isn‚Äôt all that important what the ‚Äòenvelope‚Äô is in which the data is conveyed, as long as the assurances for provenance and integrity (and perhaps some others) for the data are in place. Verificable credentials are good, but so are X.509 attribute certificates, Attribute-Based Credentials ( <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319144382" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ABCs</a>), etc. Parties may want the ability to specify which of these (not) to use, but that‚Äôs a secondary concern.</p><p>In short, as an issuer, a party is interested in creating value from sharing knowledge about other entities. A party‚Äôs ‚Äúissuer‚Äù governance process is concerned with making (and continually reviewing and updating) decisions about e.g.:</p><ul><li>the kinds of qualified data it is willing to provide (what they consist of, what characteristics are to be ensured, liability to take, etc.;</li><li>the kinds of credentials (‚Äòenvelopes‚Äô) it is willing to use for providing that data;</li><li>under which conditions such credentials may be issued (e.g. only to a party that is mentioned in the qualified data);</li><li>how all this is communicated: published, advertised and marketed (both in machine-readable and human readable form, for different purposes/audiences).</li></ul><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-validator-perspective"></a>The Validator Perspective<a class="hash-link" href="#the-validator-perspective" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>In its role as a validator<sup id="fnref-10"><a href="#fn-10" class="footnote-ref">10</a></sup>, a party is seeking to create value by efficiently obtaining data that is valid<sup id="fnref-11"><a href="#fn-11" class="footnote-ref">11</a></sup> for further processing for specific purposes. Such processing includes doing computations with the data, or using it as a value for a variable/placeholder in a rule that needs to be evaluated for the purpose of making some decision. In this document, we will generically think of this as that the party has various ‚Äòformulae‚Äô<sup id="fnref-12"><a href="#fn-12" class="footnote-ref">12</a></sup> that it needs to be processed or evaluated for specific purposes, and doing so requires the ‚Äòvariables‚Äô (fields) of these formulae to be assigned a value.</p><p>The validator perspective is about obtaining such data (through the SSI infrastructure or otherwise), determining whether or not evaluation of the formula would be valid if the data were assigned to specific variables (validation), and if so, assign the obtained data to such variables.</p><p>Obtaining data through the SSI infrastructure requires that the party first needs to track down which issuers exist and what kinds of credentials they issue, i.e. the kinds of data that they contain, and further characteristics. It is needed to create and maintain a mapping between (fields) from credentials from specific issuers and ‚Äòvariables‚Äô in the formulae that it uses in its business processes. Such a mapping would also include ‚Äòvalidation criteria‚Äô<sup id="fnref-13"><a href="#fn-13" class="footnote-ref">13</a></sup>, i.e. formulae whose variables can be populated by the meta-data of credentials, such the expiration date, and that are used to decide whether or not data from a credential can serve as the value of a variable in the formula. We will refer to such mappings (and their validation criteria) as a ‚Äòvalidation policy‚Äô.</p><p>Machine-readable validation policies enable generic IT to collect data for populating a formula using the SSI infrastructure, with the guarantee that such data is valid for the purpose in which the formula is used. Human-readable validation policies enable the designated employees of the organization to do the same, using other kinds of infrastructure (e.g. Internet, phone, mail, ‚Ä¶).</p><p>In short, as a validator, a party creates value by obtaining data that is valid for processing in specific cases. A party‚Äôs ‚Äúvalidator‚Äù governance process is concerned with making (and continually reviewing and updating) qualified decisions about e.g.:</p><ul><li>the mapping between variables in formulae, and fields from credentials of specific issuers;</li><li>validation criteria for each of these mappings;</li><li>what risks it runs in case the claims made within the credential are not true, and what assurances may be called for in order to reduce such risks to an acceptable level</li></ul><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-holder-perspective"></a>The Holder Perspective<a class="hash-link" href="#the-holder-perspective" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>In the holder role, a party is seeking to create value by collecting and managing (qualified) data for later use, by itself, or by presenting it to others e.g. within the context of a business transaction. The value comes mainly from the fact that handling such data is done electronically, using the SSI infrastructure, thereby avoiding most of the (costly, time consuming and annoying) problems that people face if they had to do this by hand (as explained <a href="#why-ssi---saving-time-and-money-on-bureaucracy">earlier</a>).</p><p>In the holder role, a party is predominantly concerned with how to respond to presentation requests that it receives from other parties that collect data (for populating a formula) and making qualified decisions. Such requests would state which fields of specific kinds of (possibly multiple) credentials are needed, and might also state the validation criteria. Collecting the requested (meta-)data, wrapping it into a presentation format and ‚Äòissuing‚Äô it to the requester suggests that the party is actually performing in an issuer role. Note that collecting and presenting data in the requested format does not mean that the data needs to be changed.</p><p>However, in this (holder) role a party may also want to know more about the party that it receives presentation requests from, e.g. who it is, whether it is registered as an enterprise with the national Chamber of Commerce, etc, and it may also need assurances. That would mean that it would simultaneously/intermittently also have to perform the verifier role<sup id="fnref-14"><a href="#fn-14" class="footnote-ref">14</a></sup>.</p><p>In this sense, a holder seems to combine both issuer and verifier/validator perspectives. The holder takes the issuer mindset when presenting the asked qualified data, possibly from multiple sources. The verifier viewpoint is taken when a holder checks whether it trusts the validator enough to share the qualified data with.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="automated-decision-making-requires-argument-construction"></a>Automated decision making requires argument construction<a class="hash-link" href="#automated-decision-making-requires-argument-construction" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The Issuer and Validator perspectives show that (support for) decision making is one of the important contributions of SSI.

Such argument specifications can take the form of a tree, where the root-node represents the final conclusion, and other nodes represent sub-arguments that their parent node combines using a function such as ‚ÄòAND‚Äô or ‚ÄòOR‚Äô.</p><p>This breaking down of the argument in sub-arguments, in a tree-like structure, makes its governance more manageable. For example, deciding whether or not a person should be given access to some digital service may be broken down in an argument for deciding this in case the person is an employee and the case in which (s)he is a customer.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="arguments-for-automated-decision-making-require-governance"></a>Arguments for automated decision making require governance<a class="hash-link" href="#arguments-for-automated-decision-making-require-governance" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The governance of arguments may be done in a distributed fashion, meaning that the task of establishing some (set of) sub-arguments can be assigned to the people that are best suited for that. For example, the basic argument to decide whether or not someone may access a particular bank-account might be ‚Äúauthenticated person owns bank-account‚Äù. There may however be legal situations in which someone else should also be given access. This can be done by introducing ‚Äúauthenticated person has a legal right to access bank-account‚Äù. We leave the governance of the argument that establishes whether or not this is the case up to the legal department.</p><p>The ability to break down arguments and distribute their governance can also help mitigate the risk of making wrong decisions. In high-risk situations, the governance of specific sub-arguments can be delegated to (e.g. risk and compliance) officers that have the skills to construct these arguments such that they provide the necessary assurance to reduce the risks to an acceptable level. An example is given in the section ‚Äò<a href="#tools-and-services-that-support-business-decision-making">Tools and Services That Support Decision Making</a>‚Äô</p><p>For completeness sake, we mention that a distinct part of the governance of arguments is the specification of the assurances that must be in place for data to qualify as valid for the position where it is applied in the argument. This has already been covered <a href="#the-validator-perspective">earlier</a>, when we discussed validation policies. Basically, qualified data (for some argument) is data that comes with the assurances that are specified in the appropriate validation policy.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="arguments-for-automated-decision-making-require-assurances"></a>Arguments for automated decision making require assurances<a class="hash-link" href="#arguments-for-automated-decision-making-require-assurances" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Assurances can be all sorts of things, as long as they contribute to the mitigation of risks of parties that make decisions. A party that wants to sell a house needs assurances that enable him to sue the buyer in case he doesn‚Äôt pay. A proof of the buyer‚Äôs identity that is acceptable to the courts in which he may sue that person would be an example of such an assurance. Another kind of assurance would be a downpayment.</p><p>Note that assurances are subjective. Something that would provide you with assurance in a certain case may not do so for me in that case.</p><p>For SSI, we have specific things that might serve as assurance. One such thing is cryptographic proofs. One can use such proofs e.g. to establish the integrity of a credential (i.e. that it hasn‚Äôt been changed since it was issued), or its provenance. Also, such proofs may be used to establish links between credentials, and much more. Good cryptographic proofs have a solid mathematical basis that gives them the property that they cannot be denied.</p><p>As is in the name, the SSI-ACs care about assurance between the parties that are part of the community. The parties can decide for themselves what assurance means for them, what kind of credentials are needed, and how they want to express this. A possibility for expressing this is a ‚ÄòLevel of Assurance‚Äô or LoA. A LoA can be an integer in the range of 1-4 or 5, which identifies a set of (objective) statements that allegedly apply to some situation or equipment, where these statements are designed to provide assurance. LoAs are typically claimed by one party, within a certain context, and such statements can be trusted by other parties, just as any other claim. Examples of how LoAs are currently used, are the <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NIST 800-63</a>, that provides levels of assurance for identity proofing (IAL), authentication (AAL) and strength of an assertion in a federated environment (FAL), and the <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/45138.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ISO/IEC 29115</a>, that provides a framework for managing entity authentication assurance, including 4 LoA‚Äôs (for entity authentication).</p><p>In general, a statement can be (part of) an assurance for a specific party if this party can use the statement to contribute to risk mitigation. SSI allows us to request any statement, including assurance statements that are needed for decision making.</p><p>For example, a party that is electronically negotiating a transaction with another party, and that wants to mitigate the risks of that party using a rogue digital agent, may request an accreditation credential (issued by a well-known/trusted accreditor) that states the set of security requirements that this agent satisfies.</p><p>There is a business in providing credentials that contain statements that are valued in the market as providing assurance. For example, it is conceivable that a party runs a digital service that allows digital agents to be registered when installed, and that at a later time can remotely test the digital agent for any (rogue) modifications, and issue an (ephemeral) credential stating the results of such checks. If properly designed and implemented, such services may contribute significantly to the uptake of SSI, particularly if they also were to take on some liability in case things go wrong.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="outsourcing-assurance-to-ssi-assurance-communities-ssi-acs"></a>Outsourcing assurance to SSI Assurance Communities (SSI-ACs)<a class="hash-link" href="#outsourcing-assurance-to-ssi-assurance-communities-ssi-acs" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>The difficulties that the governance of information processes bring along, particularly when the result of such processes should be (digital, machine-readable) policies and regulations that are fit for use by computers, is a major obstacle for organizations to adopt SSI, and transform their business processes and IT. This is nothing new. Since computers have been used by businesses, the existence of this business-technology gap has been recognized, and people have tried to come to grips with it.</p><p>This document proposes several additions to the tools that have up till now been used for this. These tools assume the existence of an operational SSI infrastructure. Also, they capitalize on existing mechanisms for providing trust and assurance by observing that trust and assurance work best in a community of parties that have some common objectives, and because of that, find it more beneficial to work together in some areas than having to do all the work themselves.</p><p>They do not seek to provide rules/standards that should be followed world-wide, but rather they consent to a set of rules that they can all work with, for the particular purposes that they share and the concerns they collectively want to address. They will often allow others to join if they find that beneficial. We will use the term ‚ÄòSSI Assurance Community‚Äô or SSI-AC to refer to such communities.<sup id="fnref-16"><a href="#fn-16" class="footnote-ref">16</a></sup></p><p><a href="/ctwg-sandbox/docs/media/image3.png"></a>{width=&quot;3.7968755468066493in&quot; height=&quot;1.8297659667541557in&quot;}</p><p>Figure 1: Constituents and Subscribers of an SSI-AC</p><p>An illustrative example of such SSI-AC could be the Dutch ‚ÄúOutbreak Management Team‚Äù (OMT) that consists of people from the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, research institutions, medical societies, etc. The OMT is a standing organization, that only convenes when ‚Äúexisting scenarios offer too little guidance&quot; (to government, the public, or enterprises regarding the ways in which to behave in situations with specified health risks) in the outbreak of an infectious disease. It is their task to propose additional guidance for specific situations. In the current COVID-19 crisis, their advice to the Dutch government deals with what citizens should (not) do, what kinds of enterprises are to be temporarily shut down, etc. This task makes them ideally suited to also become a SSI-AC that specifies the necessary SSI support that organizations and citizens need, e.g. the kinds of credentials that citizens should be issued after having been tested, accreditation credentials for trusted testing facilities, etc.</p><p>A SSI-AC is constructed and maintained by (representatives of) organizations - which we will call its ‚Äòconstituents‚Äô - which perform the governance. They specify its scope (what (not) to consider), the products and services that the SSI-AC will govern (and perhaps also realize) for the purpose of facilitating organizations to obtain assurances and build or maintain trust.</p><p>A SSI-AC may typically provide products and services that organizations need to adopt SSI and transform their business processes and IT, such as:</p><ul><li>Credential Type support, e.g. in terms of specifying their structure and semantics, supporting the advertisement of such specifications and the searching/finding of them;</li><li>Accreditation support, e.g. in terms of maintaining lists of ‚Äòtrusted issuers/verifiers/holders‚Äô, specifying accreditation schemas and providing for the issuing and use of accreditation credentials associated with such schemes,</li><li>Decision-Tree support, e.g. defining arguments for certain types of decisions, specifying validation policies for the data that such arguments need, providing a service that can push updates of such arguments and validation policies to subscribers, and perhaps even a generic (locally deployable) service for the evaluation of such arguments in given contexts.</li></ul><p>Organizations that use products and/or services of a SSI-AC are called ‚Äòsubscribers‚Äô. Organizations are self-sovereign in deciding which SSI-AC(s) to subscribe to. They may want to subscribe to multiple SSI-ACs.<sup id="fnref-17"><a href="#fn-17" class="footnote-ref">17</a></sup> We use the term ‚ÄòSSI-AC member‚Äô as a party that engages with the SSI-AC, either as a constituent or a subscriber.</p><p>We like to think of a SSI-AC as a service-oriented community that has a limited focus, such as in the example of the Dutch OMT, exists for the benefit of its members, and realizes that it is just one of many such communities. The latter means that a SSI-AC may decide to become a member of another SSI-AC, reaping the benefits associated with that SSI-AC. For example the Dutch OMT may decide to become a constituent of some European Covid-19 SSI-AC, together with similar SSI-ACs from other EU countries. There, they could support credential types, accreditations and decision-tree support that would allow e.g. for EU cross-border use of credentials as they are governed by the different constituents.</p><p>In other words, a SSI-AC is a formal or informal, temporary or persistent organization that consists of different constituents (individuals, enterprises, governments) whose task is to at least govern<sup id="fnref-18"><a href="#fn-18" class="footnote-ref">18</a></sup> the SSI-AC (and optionally providing one or more of the products/services that it governs).

The payload is a set of statements that parties issue (and other parties are interested in). The ‚Äòenvelope‚Äô is just another (yet possibly standardized) means of transporting that payload with some basic assurances. For example, a bare passport document (as it comes from the printing house) is an ‚Äòenvelope‚Äô, and the payload is whatever is added (statements, photo, fingerprints) etc. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#credential-subject" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VC data model spec</a> specifies an envelope where the payload/contents are to be put in the `credentialSubject`<sup id="fnref-21"><a href="#fn-21" class="footnote-ref">21</a></sup> section.

It is up to the individual parties to decide what data is (in)valid for what kinds of decisions. Its ‚Äúvalidator‚Äù governance process is concerned with making (and continually reviewing and updating) such decisions.</p><p>Data is valid (to be used in some kind of argument) if the party ‚Äòtrusts‚Äô it.

It is easier to believe this when the data comes with assurances, which come in various flavors (as discussed in the section on <a href="#arguments-for-automated-decision-making-require-assurances">assurances</a>).</p><p>SSI-ACs may play a significant role in providing a specific kind of assurance, namely ‚Äòaccreditations‚Äô. Accreditation is the formal recognition of a party‚Äôs competence to conduct a specific activity such as issuing, holding and/or verifying a specific kind of credential, or certifying parties. Such recognition is based on that party demonstrating compliance with a set of criteria (the accreditation scheme) to another party that is properly qualified (accredited) to conduct compliance assessments.</p><p>SSI-ACs are in an excellent position to define accreditation schemes that serve the (shared) purposes of its members, and any party that sees benefits in being accredited against such a scheme could apply for an accreditation assessment.</p><p>Accreditation schemes come in various flavors.

Support Business Decision Making<a class="hash-link" href="#tools-and-services-that-support-business-decision-making" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Whenever a party wants to make a well-considered decision, it needs to establish the argument on which to base it. As we explained <a href="#automated-decision-making-requires-argument-construction">earlier</a>, an argument can be seen as a tree where each node can be seen as a variable whose value is the result of doing some computation with (the values of the nodes of) its branches, or if it has no branches, it may simply be assigned some value (boolean, integer, date, ‚Ä¶).</p><p>Nodes, particularly when they have multiple branches, can be assigned a name that acts as a variable that can be evaluated, i.e. assigned a value. For example, a node called ‚Äúauthenticated person owns bank-account‚Äù might evaluate to ‚Äòtrue‚Äô, ‚Äòfalse‚Äô or ‚Äònon-evaluable‚Äô. A node called ‚Äúpersonnel‚Äù may evaluate to a list of people (identifiers) that are considered personnel (employees, or hired staff).</p><p>Here is a fictional example of what a tree might look like for dealing with a request for accessing a bank account. The root node, called ‚Äòbankaccount‚Äô, will evaluate to the account that the requestor has selected from all bank accounts that (s)he has a right to access. In its simplest form, that would be the bank accounts that (s)he owns:</p><p>(<a href="/ctwg-sandbox/docs/media/image2.png"></a>{width=&quot;6.692913385826771in&quot; height=&quot;1.6666666666666667in&quot;})</p><p>Figure 4: Fictional example of decision tree for accessing a bank account.</p><p>However, if the bank provides the owner of a bank account with the service to mandate other people to access their bank account, this has to be reflected in the decision tree as well: a requestor then also gets to select from the accounts for which (s)he is a mandatee, as follows:</p><p><a href="/ctwg-sandbox/docs/media/image4.png"></a>{width=&quot;6.692913385826771in&quot; height=&quot;2.5049289151356082in&quot;}</p><p>Figure 5: Grafting a new branch on the decision tree.</p><p>As time progresses, all sorts of other situations will pop up that cause subtrees to be grafted (added to one of the existing nodes), causing the decision tree to become ever more complex over time. Moreover, since the proper design of these subtrees may require ever more specialized expertise, their governance quickly becomes unmanageable. An example is dealing with legal rights that people may have to access a bank account of others. For example, if your partner, parents or child has died, if you have been appointed as a guardian of someone that is incapable of doing its own financial administration, if you are a police officer that is tasked with tracking down bank frauds, etc. Such a decision tree might then look like this:</p><p><a href="/ctwg-sandbox/docs/media/image1.png"></a>{width=&quot;6.692913385826771in&quot; height=&quot;3.6805555555555554in&quot;}</p><p>Figure 6: Grafting a branch the execution of which may be outsourced.</p><p>As we explained <a href="#automated-decision-making-requires-argument-construction">earlier</a>, we can outsource the governance and design of individual nodes to parties within or outside of our own organization that have the specific knowledge and experience to design them.</p><p>We propose that SSI-ACs can provide such services, i.e. design decision trees that others can use as a node in their own decision trees. In the above picture, the decision tree with node ‚Äòlegally accessible accounts‚Äô could be designed by a SSI-AC that has in-depth knowledge of the law, and since that would be the same for every bank in that jurisdiction, all of them could use that tree as a node in their own decision trees.</p><p>The SSI-AC can provide various services for this. One would be that it would provide code that subscribers can download and install in their own IT equipment. Such code could come with various assurances regarding its correctness, efficiency etc. Alternatively, the SSI-AC could provide an IT service and endpoint where subscribers could request the evaluation of the node, where the result could contain proofs of execution correctness.</p><p>We can also foresee that such trees can be provisioned through a new capability that we propose the SSI infrastructure to have, being the requesting and provisioning of qualified (sub)decisions. The SSI infrastructure then not only goes after some qualified data, but also actually processes it into the result of evaluating a decision tree with such data.</p><p>Obviously, the SSI-AC would then also need to have a ‚Äòdecision-tree catalogue‚Äô in which it can advertise the kinds of decisions that the various decisions-trees can produce, the kinds of (qualified) data that are involved, the ways in which subscribers can use such trees (in-house or as-a-service), properties (e.g. ‚Äòguaranteed to be compliant with current legislation‚Äô), etc.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="conclusions"></a>Conclusions<a class="hash-link" href="#conclusions" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>We have explored a set of related ideas that we collectively refer to as ‚Äúdecentralized SSI governance‚Äù, the main purpose these concepts is to help organizations transform their IT, business-process artifacts and policies to enable them to use SSI and reap its benefits.</p><p>We have identified several of such benefits, not just saving time and money, but also that using SSI may contribute to diminishing the ‚Äòdigital divide‚Äô, because it prevents people from giving up on filling in digital forms as they encounter all sorts of difficulties.</p><p>We have also identified obstacles to the adoption of SSI by organizations, postulating that the electronic exchange of qualified data - using an SSI infrastructure - should be just as easy as the electronic exchange of arbitrary data - using the Internet, i.e. TCP/IP infrastructure. We have assumed that over time, such an SSI infrastructure will become available as a commodity and use the current trust networks as a basis.</p><p>The adoption and transformation challenges that remain have to do with</p><ul><li><strong>qualified data</strong>, i.e. data that comes with assurances regarding provenance, integrity, and possibly others. We have described the related concerns from the perspective of providing such data (issuer perspective), obtaining and using such data for further processing (validator perspective), and holding such data (holder perspective). We conclude that organizations need governance processes that establish and maintain policies for providing and validating such data.</li><li><strong>argument construction</strong>, i.e. governance processes for establishing arguments, which is the reasoning by which decisions are being made in an organization, and the possibility to outsource the (partial) design of such arguments, particularly in cases where specific (expert) knowledge and experience is required.</li><li><strong>assurances</strong> related to qualified data, other than those regarding its provenance and integrity. We have identified various sources of such assurances as well as different ways to communicate them in terms of (un)qualified data.</li></ul><p>Then, we have introduced the idea of a SSI Assurance Community, that is a (often already existing) community of organizations that already work together for some purposes and have established trust mechanisms that they can rely on. We propose to leverage such communities and their trust mechanisms for the purpose of furthering the adoption of SSI, and the related transformation of organizations.</p><p>We do so by proposing the development of tools to support</p><ul><li><strong>Credential markets</strong>. One example is ‚Äòcredential catalogues‚Äô, that organizations and/or SSI-ACs can use to advertise the definitions of the payloads of credentials that they govern, providing all information that other parties may need to determine whether or not using such credentials would be beneficial for them. Another example is the ‚Äòyellow pages service‚Äô, which is a service that allows such parties to find the various credential catalogues that may be of interest to them.</li><li><strong>Accreditation schemes</strong> that can be used for the accreditation of parties as they issue, hold, or verify credentials as well as for the accreditation of IT that performs such functions. Specifically, we proposed a generic kind of accreditation credential, and we show how it can be used in a way that is integratable with SSI infrastructure.</li><li><strong>Decision tree development and execution</strong>, where such trees can be used as nodes in the decision trees of SSI-AC subscribers, thus freeing them from difficult governance tasks and the implementation of the resulting decision policies. While we expect this to potentially become a huge benefit, more work is needed to explore this idea.</li></ul><p>Taking it all together, SSI-ACs propose to help the adoption of SSI, so that the current bureaucratic information exchange processes are easier, both for individuals as well as organizations. Using the SSI-ACs, it is possible to leverage the present trust communities and corresponding mechanisms, while at the same time automating the business decisions that are experienced as cumbersome. Different credential types, accreditation, machine readable policies and decision tree support are an essential part in decentralized governance. To reach these potentials that the SSI-ACs can offer, different tooling and services are suggested. Such tools and services will need to be better specified, and some perhaps also standardized.</p><hr><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="notes"></a>Notes<a class="hash-link" href="#notes" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><div class="footnotes"><hr><ol><li id="fn-1">IT-links connect IT-systems that are governed/managed by different parties (internal or external to an enterprise or government).

What we propose in this paper is a more generalized form of this concept that goes into more details.<a href="#fnref-16" class="footnote-backref">‚Ü©</a></li><li id="fn-17">The discovery of SSI-ACs is a non-technical topic that resembles the way you discover the kinds of laws and regulations that apply to you(r business). You do that, e.g. by talking to peer organizations, governmental bodies (e.g. chamber of commerce), business associations, company lawyers, etc. It is conceivable that a SSI-AC exists, or will be created, that will maintain a register of SSI-ACs (that may be accredited as such by some scheme).<a href="#fnref-17" class="footnote-backref">‚Ü©</a></li><li id="fn-18">See also the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zUnPom-JYqL8zKsPHf_VkBIZBISmFYE2tSdz6o51m6c/edit#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">COVID-19 Credentials (‚ÄúC19C‚Äù) Governance Framework</a>.<a href="#fnref-18" class="footnote-backref">‚Ü©</a></li><li id="fn-19">This does not necessarily mean that the SSI-AC itself provides such products/services; it may also outsource this.<a href="#fnref-19" class="footnote-backref">‚Ü©</a></li><li id="fn-20">The idea is that verifiers may decide to trust any issuer in the trusted-issuers list of particular SSI-ACs, effectively (partially, at least) outsourcing the vetting work of what would be trusted issuers.<a href="#fnref-20" class="footnote-backref">‚Ü©</a></li><li id="fn-21">This may be a bit confusing because ‚Äòsubject‚Äô usually refers to some entity, whereas ‚ÄòcredentialSubject‚Äô is a set of statements about different entities.<a href="#fnref-21" class="footnote-backref">‚Ü©</a></li><li id="fn-22">‚Äòvalidation‚Äô is the process that parties use to determine whether or not a specific data element can be used in a specific argument. These processes are not only subjective - they are unique for every party, but they also depend on the kind of argument that is under consideration. Data that a party considers valid for one kind of decision may not be valid for another, and vice versa.<a href="#fnref-22" class="footnote-backref">‚Ü©</a></li><li id="fn-23">Implicitly: by describing in the accreditation credential type specification what this trust consists of, i.e. what it has decided to believe about the (issuer) organization, and what assurances it has obtained (and perhaps also: how it has obtained these assurances) that convinced it to hold this trust/belief. Explicitly: by including claims in the accreditation credential that state the obtained assurances for this particular issuer organization.<a href="#fnref-23" class="footnote-backref">‚Ü©</a></li><li id="fn-24">The accreditation scheme implies the functions that the party can be trusted to properly execute. So you might have a ‚Äòtrusted issuer‚Äô, or ‚Äòtrusted verifier‚Äô accreditation schemes for specific kinds of credentials, as well as of certifying parties against such schemes.<a href="#fnref-24" class="footnote-backref">‚Ü©</a></li><li id="fn-25">Doing this, and including the payload of the accreditation credential in every credential that is issued under this regime, enables verifiers to check the trustworthiness of the issuer based on the SSI-ACs assessment without needing to know who the actual issuer is. The exact/preferred ways of doing this remain to be determined. Candidates include using (pseudonymous) DIDs, and also with ZKP VCs.<a href="#fnref-25" class="footnote-backref">‚Ü©</a></li><li id="fn-26">If a SSI-AC decides to outsource its accreditation process, it should make sure that the associated accreditation credential types that it specifies make verification and validation as easy as possible. There are several possibilities: the SSI-AC can allow organizations to use its ‚Äòaccreditation credential signing service‚Äô if they present a credential that states they are a SSI-AC accreditor (so every accreditation credential is signed with a single key that is owned/controlled by the SSI-AC). Alternatively, accreditors may issue accreditation credentials that also include the accreditation credential of the accreditor (there is recursion here‚Ä¶). And there are more ways.<a href="#fnref-26" class="footnote-backref">‚Ü©</a></li><li id="fn-27">As with ISO certification: different management systems of an organization may be certified: the quality management system (ISO 9001), environment management system (ISO 14001), the information security management system (ISO 27001), etc.<a href="#fnref-27" class="footnote-backref">‚Ü©</a></li><li id="fn-28">In the Netherlands, the Burger Service Number (BSN - i.e. the Dutch social security number) may only be legally used within the government, for health purposes, and by banks. Certifying other organizations against a ‚Äòtrusted verifier‚Äô scheme might provide sufficient assurances to allow them to use government issued credentials that contain this number.<a href="#fnref-28" class="footnote-backref">‚Ü©</a></li><li id="fn-29">Note that where ‚Äòtrusted issuers‚Äô and ‚Äòtrusted verifiers‚Äô refer to parties (individuals, organizations), for the holder role we need the actual equipment (wallet app, edge/cloud agent) to be certified, because it is that equipment that will do the actual receiving of credentials, and creating presentations.<a href="#fnref-29" class="footnote-backref">‚Ü©</a></li><li id="fn-30">In order to enforce a SSI-AC policy that states that trusted credentials may only be issued by trusted issuers and requested/used by trusted verifiers, we need realize ourselves that the holder agent (wallet app) does not just perform the holder role, but also the verifier role because it should be capable of asking ‚Äòthe verifier‚Äô for its accreditation credential, and only use a trusted credential (under that SSI-AC policy) if the verifier has one (this is also referred to as the ‚Äòverify the verifier‚Äô capability).<a href="#fnref-30" class="footnote-backref">‚Ü©</a></li><li id="fn-31">This credential content is fictitious, and may be replaced with whatever else may be appropriate.<a href="#fnref-31" class="footnote-backref">‚Ü©</a></li></ol></div></div></article><div class="margin-vert--lg"><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_2xL- thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#summary" class="table-of-contents__link">Summary</a></li><li><a href="#why-ssi---saving-time-and-money-on-bureaucracy" class="table-of-contents__link">Why SSI -
