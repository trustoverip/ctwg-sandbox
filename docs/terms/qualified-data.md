### Short Description
**Qualified Data** is data that has assurances, at least regarding its provenance and integrity, and that can be combined electronically in semantically valid ways. There are two kinds of Qualified Data:
1. data that comes with assurances (qualifications) that an %%issuer|issuer%% provides with the data in a (verifiable) credential;
2. data that comes with the assurance that a %%verifier|verifier%% needs in order to decide that this data is valid to be used for the purpose(s) he intends to use that data for.

### Purpose
**Qualified Data** serves to make decision making easier: when a %%party|party%% needs data for a specific purpose, and is able to specify  the assurances it needs to decide that the data is valid for use for such purposes, the party can then simply request such data, and specify these assurances. If a response comes, and the assurance proofs work out, the party does not need to do any work to decide whether or not that data is valid.

### Criterion
An **Qualified Data** is data that has assurances, at least regarding its provenance and integrity, and that can be combined electronically in semantically valid ways.
