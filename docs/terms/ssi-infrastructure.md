### Short Description
An **SSI Infrastructure** is a set of technical (IT) components that make it easy for all (SSI-enabled) business (IT) applications to provide, acquire and/or use %%qualified data|qualified data%%. It is similar to the Internet infrastrucutre, except that the data that is being requested and provided comes with assurances (qualifications).

### Purpose
Like the Internet, where applications are shielded from the many different underlying (local) networks and their protocols, an SSI Infrastructure shields applications from the many different types of credentials, proofs, wallets, etc. This significantly reduces the operational business tasks of validating data that enters the organization, making it much faster and much cheaper. One can say that it allows %%parties|party%% to replace their (run-time) validation activities by (define-time) %%governance|governance%% of (%%digital|digital-policy%%) %%policies|policy%%.

### Criterion
An **SSI Infrastructure** is a community of %%parties|party%% that have some common objectives regarding assurances that are necessary for providing, acquiring and/or using specific kinds of %%qualified data|qualified data%%.
