### Short Description
An **SSI Assurance Community** is a community of parties that have some common objectives regarding assurances that are necessary for providing, acquiring and/or using specific kinds of qualified data. It is typical of such communities that they do not seek to provide or specify global rules or standards. Rather, an SSI Assurance Community seeks consensus between its members that allow them to provid, acquire and/or use the specific kinds data that they already work with amongst each other. 

Many communities already exist that aim to serve the (shared) objectives of their members. Whenever the members of such a community have an interest in sharing (qualfied) data, the community can easily become an SSI Assurance Community by serving such interests by capitalizing on the already existing mechanisms for providing trust and assurance between its members. 

An SSI Assurance Community may seek to support its members e.g. by 
- supporting the governance and advertising of specific %%credential types|credential-type%%;
- supporting the governance and advertising of specific decision trees;
- supporting accreditation schemes, processes and credentials.

### Purpose
An **SSI Assurance Community** serves its members by relieving them of governance tasks, e.g. in the area of credential types, accreditation schemes, and decision trees.

### Criterion
An **SSI Assurance Community** is a community of parties that have some common objectives regarding assurances that are necessary for providing, acquiring and/or using specific kinds of qualified data.
